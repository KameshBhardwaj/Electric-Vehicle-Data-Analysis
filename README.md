# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

### Overview
This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) data using Tableau to explore trends in EV adoption, types, and regional distribution. The analysis provides insights into Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) in the United States from 2010 onward.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Electric Range:** 67.83 miles (average range for electric vehicles in the dataset)
- **Total Vehicles:** 150,413
- **Total BEV Vehicles:** 116,745 (77.6% of total vehicles)
- **Total PHEV Vehicles:** 33,668 (22.4% of total vehicles)

### Analysis & Visualizations
#### 1. Total Vehicles by Model Year (From 2010 Onwards)
- **Visualization Type:** Line/Area Chart
- **Insight:** EV sales have grown over time, starting from **0.8k** in 2011 to **1.6k** in 2012. Sales peaked at **37.1k** in 2023, but experienced a decline in **2019** (10.7k) and **2020** (11.3k). This chart highlights the increasing adoption of EVs over the years.

#### 2. Total Vehicles by State
- **Visualization Type:** Map of the USA
- **Insight:** Washington leads in EV adoption with **150,082** vehicles, showing the highest concentration of EV users. This map highlights states with the largest EV populations, showcasing regional differences in EV adoption.

#### 3. Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make
- **Visualization Type:** Bar Chart
- **Insight:** Tesla holds the top position among EV manufacturers, followed by Nissan and Chevrolet, with Jeep ranking 10th. This chart shows the distribution of EVs by make, highlighting leading manufacturers.

#### 4. Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility
- **Visualization Type:** Donut Chart
- **Insight:** Vehicles are segmented based on Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility, showing the distribution of EVs that meet clean fuel standards.

### Interactive Filters
The dashboard includes filters to customize the data view:
- **CAFV Eligibility**
- **EV Type (BEV/PHEV)**
- **Make and Model**
- **State**

These filters allow users to explore EV trends based on specific criteria, enhancing the interactivity of the dashboard.

### Future Analysis & Planning
Possible directions for further analysis include:
1. **Trend Analysis of EV Sales**: Investigate the factors contributing to sales drops in 2019 and 2020, such as economic shifts or policy changes.
2. **Predictive Analysis for EV Adoption**: Use predictive modeling to project future EV adoption rates based on historical trends.
3. **Comparative Analysis of BEV and PHEV Adoption**: Study consumer preferences for BEVs over PHEVs, focusing on infrastructure availability, cost, and technological advancements.
4. **Range Improvement Trends**: Analyze how total electric range has improved over time and identify which manufacturers are leading in range efficiency.
